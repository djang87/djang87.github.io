**Abstract:**
DNS(Domain Name Service) is a request/response service based on UDP client-server. DNS spoofing attack is an activity which an attacker manipulates
DNS traffic, thus creating a fake/false DNS response.
consequently this attack will lead the client into malicious website. This attack is more threatening in
wireless network. In this paper we will demonstrate the DNS spoofing attack in public wireless network and
propose a defense system which effectively detects and
protects the attack in AP(Access Point) level. To verify
the effectiveness of our proposal, we have built our own
system and conducted some experiments. As the result,
we have concluded the proposal of this paper can
effectively defend DNS Spoofing from public wireless
network in terms of maintaining original network
protocol and client system.
