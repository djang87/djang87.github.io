<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
Heap randomization, in general, has been a well-trodden area; however, the efficacy of byte-granularity randomization has
never been fully explored as misalignment raises various concerns. Modern heap exploits often abuse the determinism in word
alignment, and modern CPU architecture better supports unaligned access (since Nehalem). Based on such new developments, we
conduct an in-depth analysis of evaluating the efficacy of byte-granularity heap randomization in three folds: (i) security effectiveness,
(ii) performance impact, and (iii) compatibility analysis to measure deployment cost.</p>
