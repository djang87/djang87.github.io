<strong>Abstract:</strong>
In recent years, there are increasing
threats of rootkits that undermine the integrity of a
system by manipulating OS kernel. To cope with the
rootkits, in Vigilare, the snoop-based monitoring
which snoops the memory traffics of the host system
was proposed. Although the previous work shows its
detection capability and negligible performance loss,
the problem is that the proposed design is not
acceptable in recent commodity mobile application
processors (APs) which have become de facto the
standard computing platforms of smart devices. To
mend this problem and adopt the idea of snoop-based
monitoring in commercial products, in this paper, we
propose a snoop-based monitor design called S-Mon,
which is designed for the AP platforms. In designing
S-Mon, we especially consider two design constraints
in the APs which were not addressed in Vigilare; the
unified memory model and the crossbar switch
interconnect. Taking into account those, we derive a
more realistic architecture for the snoop-based
monitoring and a new hardware module, called the
region controller, is also proposed. In our experiments
on a simulation framework modeling a production- quality device, it is shown that our S-Mon can detect
the rootkit attacks while the runtime overhead is also
negligible.</p>
