<strong>Abstract:</strong> 
External hardware-based kernel integrity monitors
have been proposed to mitigate kernel-level malwares. However,
the existing external approaches have been limited to monitoring
the static regions of kernel while the latest rootkits manipulate
the dynamic kernel objects. To address the issue, we present
KI-Mon, a hardware-based platform that introduces eventtriggered monitoring techniques for kernel dynamic objects. KIMon advances the bus traffic snooping technique to not only
detect memory write traffic on the host bus but also filter out
all but meaningful traffic to generate events. We show how
kernel invariant verification software can be developed around
these events, and also provide a set of APIs for additional
invariant verification development. We also report our findings
and considerations on the unique challenges for external monitors
â€“ such as cache coherency, dynamic object tracing. We introduce
host-side kernel changes that alleviate these issues that involve
changes in kernelâ€™s object allocation and cache policy control. We
have built a prototype of KI-Mon on the ARM architecture to
demonstrate the efficacy of KI-Monâ€™s event-triggered mechanism
in terms of performance overhead for the monitored host system
and the processor usage of the KI-Mon processor.</p>
